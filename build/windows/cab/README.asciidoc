=== Build cabinet

CAB is a Microsoft archive format. You can read more about it https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/makecab[here] and https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb417343.aspx#dir_file_syntax[there].

I found that building a cabinet file is rather complex. It is a two-step process :

. `make` the definition file
. `build` the cabinet

To `make` the definition file, go to `build\windows\cab` and enter

[source,batch]
----
make.cmd
----

If you want more debug level, you'll use any of `-v`,  `-d` or `-dev` parameters

If `Tiny %COMSPEC% Framework` is not yet installed on your system, you'll use `-api ..\..\..`

.Example
[source,cmd]
----
make.cmd -dev -api ..\..\..
----


=== Install `Tiny %COMSPEC% Framework` from cabinet

We provide a `Tiny %COMSPEC% Framework` as a cabinet to add the ability to install it on an offline system for example.

`cab` files are simple archive. To install `Tiny %COMSPEC% Framework` from a cab file, you'll have to follow these steps :

- download `cmdfw-%VERSION%.cab`
- extract-it wherever you want. For example in `%ProgramFiles%`
- run `post-install` script

If `Tiny %COMSPEC% Framework` is not yet installed on your system, you'll have to use `-api .`

.Example
[source,cmd]
----
post-install.cmd -v -api .
----
